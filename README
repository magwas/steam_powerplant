An Open Hardware RISC-V based rugged, watercooled laptop in steampunk design.

Design Goals:

- based on the HiFive Unmatched Rev B board, because it is RISC-V
- waterproof
- shock proof
- long battery life
- water cooled
- steampunk

Not Design Goals:

- small
- lightweight

I wanted a RISC-V laptop. 
I usually carry my laptop in my car, and sometimes things happen to it.
So I choose ruggedness over lightness.
The laptop is my single most important object, so I looked up the parts I need, without regard to their price.
Well, later I added up the prices, and got a little shock.
But I have already ordered everything, so...
